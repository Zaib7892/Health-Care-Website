<span style="background-color: #2ADBFE"><u>We are an innovative team of specialists who partner with healthcare clients to profitably deliver results through data-driven marketing.</u></h2>
Healthcare is a full-service marketing and advertising agency dedicated exclusively to helping healthcare organizations attract new patients, enhance their reputations (brands) and maximize their business success. Our clients include hospitals, medical practices, pharmaceuticals, manufacturers, dental and other practices.

<h3><mark>Helping you achieve your goals.</h3></mark>
Our mission is to provide you with best-practices marketing that helps you achieve your specific goals. We don’t measure our success by work that is simply cute or clever. Instead, we create and apply proven, effective and ethical marketing systems that produce quantifiable results.

<h3><mark>A tradition of commitment, leadership and excellence</h2></mark>
We regularly speak to organizations such as Cleveland Clinic, MGMA, the American Academy of Ophthalmologists, the American College of Prosthodontists and many others. We’ve also authored articles and provided expert interviews for leading publications like the Wall Street Journal Magazine, American Medical News, Hospital Review, HealthLeaders Magazine, Medical Times, Medical Economics and others.

<h3><mark>A team dedicated to your reputation, success and ROI.</h3></mark>
Led by veteran healthcare marketing executive Stewart Gandolf, Healthcare Success’s team of 60 people has marketed more than 5,000 healthcare clients. Our team includes strategists, account managers, writers, designers, media buyers, programmers, video producers, Internet marketing specialists and other top-level talent.
